General Assembly Capstone Project (6 weeks)

## Introduction
Mental Health is becoming more and more of a prominent issue - one in four people will be affected by a mental or neurological disorder at some point in their life. And yet, it is still a difficult subject for many to talk about. People tend to try and hide this side of them from the rest of the world which is rediculous, you wouldn't be embarassed about going to the doctor after breakng your leg right?

Because Reddit facilitates annonomous posting, most people don't hold back when posting about their mental health struggles and so this gives us a large amount of accurate data to analyse. 

The goal of this project was to predict four mental health disorders (anxiety, depression, bipolar & suicide) from Reddit  posts using Natural Language Processing.
